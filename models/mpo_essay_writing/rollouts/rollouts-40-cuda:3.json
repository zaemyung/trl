Humans are born with innate biases that shape our perceptions and beliefs about others based on their race or gender. These biases can manifest in the form of discriminatory attitudes and actions towards others, whether it be in personal interactions or in broader societal structures.\n\nFor example, a study published in the Journal of Applied Psychology found that people with a history of racism were more likely to exhibit racist attitudes towards others, even when they did not express overt racism themselves. Similarly, a study published in the Journal of Social Psychology found that societal conditioning played a significant role in perpetuating gender roles and stereotypes, even among individuals who did not identify with those roles.\n\nOverall, the essay should explore the intersection of personal biases, societal conditioning, and unconscious processes in perpetuating racist and sexist behaviors."
