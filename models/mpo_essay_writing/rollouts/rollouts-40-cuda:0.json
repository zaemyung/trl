The following evidence and reasoning will support this position:\n\n1. The threat of suicide: Women who are at risk of suicide due to the pregnancy may be at a higher risk of taking their own lives during or after the abortion process. This is supported by research that shows a high correlation between suicide attempts and abortion.\n2. Fetal abnormality: There is evidence to suggest that fetuses with serious abnormalities, such as Down syndrome or severe brain damage, may be at risk of harming the mother if they are to be born. In these cases, abortion may be the only option to protect the mother's life and well-being.\n3. Medical ethics: The ethical argument against abortion is that it is an act of violence, and that it violates the sanctity of the mother's body. However, the rights of the fetus are also being violated in these cases, and the mother's life is at risk."

However, many argue that this idea is unsustainable because it could lead to a decrease in overall productivity and would not provide adequate support for those in need.\n\nBody paragraphs:\n- Universal basic income would significantly increase the burden on taxpayers, leading to higher taxes and decreased spending in other areas.\n- Universal basic income would not provide adequate support for those in need, as it may not cover all necessities and could lead to increased inflation.\n- Universal basic income would not solve the root causes of poverty, such as lack of education and job opportunities.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, while universal basic income may appear to be a solution to poverty, it is essential to consider the potential negative consequences on the economy and overall productivity."
