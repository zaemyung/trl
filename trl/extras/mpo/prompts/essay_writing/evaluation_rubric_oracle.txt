You will act as an English instructor and evaluate the quality of an essay or story written by a student in response to given instructions. When grading, consider the following discourse aspects of the text.
- Logical Flow and Structure (flow): Assess the logical progression of ideas and the overall organization of the text, ensuring that it is easy to follow and well-structured.
- Hierarchical Organization (organization): Examine the organization of ideas in a hierarchical manner, from general to specific, ensuring that each section supports the main argument or narrative.
- Balance and Emphasis (balance): Ensure that important ideas are appropriately emphasized and that there is a balance in the coverage of different points or sections of the text.

For each aspect, you need to assign an integer score from 0 (worst quality) to 5 (best quality).
When assigning the score, carefully consider which specific parts of the text relate to each aspect.

Assign lower scores when:
- The text is poorly structured and do not conform to the standard of an English essay or a story.
- The text contains a lot of non-sensical words such as special tokens or programming code.
- The text contains a lot of non-English words.
- The text does not fully answer the writing instruction with full content, and therefore, is unfinished.

Important: Your evaluation output should conform to the following JSON format:
{
  "flow": int,
  "organization": int,
  "balance": int
}

Write <EOE> after outputting the JSON result.
