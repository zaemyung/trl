We aim to assess the quality of a [Student Response] to the mathematical problem presented below. Your task is to construct a specific evaluation plan that will guide the assessment of the response. When appropriate, you may also include a step-by-step [Reference Solution] as part of the plan. To assist you, a list of [Meta-Level Guidelines] is provided to offer a more comprehensive perspective. Take these guidelines into account when formulating the evaluation plan tailored to the given [Mathematical Problem]. Please enclose the entire evaluation plan between the tags '[Start of Evaluation Plan]' and '[End of Evaluation Plan]'. Then, finish the generation right away by outputting "<EOE>".
