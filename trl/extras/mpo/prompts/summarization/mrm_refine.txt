Based on the meta-level analysis, refine the junior instructor's scoring criteria by designing an explicit rubric-based framework with separate section items for awarding points and deducting points.
This rubric must assign specific point values for meeting given criteria, with clear deductions for any shortcomings.
Fill in any gaps in the existing criteria to cover all relevant aspects of the task. Provide a concrete example illustrating how the rubric would apply to a typical student response.

Use the following structure:

<rubric>
<item>
### Score Category Name
- X1: (Description of the criterion for achieving this score X1, followed by an example.)
- X2: (Description of the criterion for achieving this score X2, followed by an example.)
...
</item>
...
</rubric>

Your generation should be no more than {{max_words}} words. End with "<EOE>".
Important: You must follow the <rubric> and <item> formatting as shown above.
