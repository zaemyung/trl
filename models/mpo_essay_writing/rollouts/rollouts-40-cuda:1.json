        "student_responses": "Libertarians should consider the Republican Party the lesser of two evils because the party has consistently supported policies that harm individual freedom and personal responsibility. This includes policies such as deregulation, tax cuts for the wealthy, and cuts to social programs. In contrast, the Democratic Party offers policies that prioritize individual freedom, such as progressive taxation, universal healthcare, and protection for worker rights."
